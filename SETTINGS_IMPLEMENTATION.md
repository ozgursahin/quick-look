# Settings Panel Implementation

## Overview
A comprehensive settings panel has been implemented with background image customization as the first feature.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Settings Panel Infrastructure
- Created `settingsSlice.js` for Redux state management
- Added settings reducer to the main store
- Created `SettingsPanel` component with modern UI design
- Added a "Settings" tab to the navigation bar

### 2. Background Image Upload
- **File Upload**: Users can click the upload area or drag and drop images
- **File Validation**: 
  - Only image files are accepted (JPG, PNG, WebP, etc.)
  - Maximum file size of 5MB
  - Error messages for invalid files
- **Preview**: Uploaded images show a preview thumbnail
- **Persistence**: Settings are saved to localStorage and persist across sessions

### 3. Background Controls
- **Default vs Custom**: Radio buttons to switch between default gradient and custom image
- **Opacity Control**: Slider to adjust background opacity (10% - 100%)
- **Blur Control**: Slider to adjust background blur effect (0px - 20px)
- **Reset Option**: Button to reset all background settings to defaults

### 4. Background Management System
- Created `BackgroundManager` component that dynamically applies background changes
- Real-time updates when settings change
- Proper cleanup and DOM manipulation
- Overlay system for opacity and blur effects
