# Sample Data Initialization Fix

## Problem
The application was automatically populating session storage with sample data on startup, even if users had previously deleted their data. This behavior was preventing users from having truly empty storage.

## Root Cause
- `tasksSlice.js` was calling `initializeSampleData()` on every app start
- `notesSlice.js` was calling `initializeSampleNotesData()` on every app start
- These functions would add sample data to session storage if it was empty
- The slices would then fall back to sample data if no saved data existed

## Changes Made

### 1. Removed Automatic Sample Data Initialization
**File: `src/store/slices/tasksSlice.js`**
- Removed import of `sampleTasks` and `initializeSampleData`
- Removed call to `initializeSampleData()` in `loadInitialState()`
- Changed initial tasks to use only `savedTasks` without fallback to sample data

**File: `src/store/slices/notesSlice.js`**
- Removed import of `sampleNotes` and `initializeSampleNotesData`
- Removed call to `initializeSampleNotesData()` in `loadInitialState()`
- Changed initial notes to use only `savedNotes` without fallback to sample data

### 2. Added Manual Sample Data Loading (Optional)
- Added `loadSampleData` action to both slices for development/testing purposes
- This action can be dispatched manually if sample data is needed
- Does not run automatically on app startup

## Behavior After Fix

### Before Fix:
- App would always ensure sample data existed in session storage
- Users couldn't have truly empty storage
- Deleting all tasks/notes would result in sample data reappearing on refresh

### After Fix:
- App starts with completely empty data if session storage is empty
- Users can delete all their data and it stays deleted
- No automatic sample data insertion
- Sample data can still be loaded manually via Redux actions if needed for testing

## How to Load Sample Data (If Needed)
For development/testing purposes, you can dispatch these actions:
```javascript
// Load sample tasks
dispatch({ type: 'tasks/loadSampleData' });

// Load sample notes  
dispatch({ type: 'notes/loadSampleData' });
```

## Result
The application now respects user data deletion and won't force sample data back into session storage. Users have full control over their data persistence.
