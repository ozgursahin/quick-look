# Storage Migration: Session Storage → Local Storage

## Problem Solved
The application was using **session storage** instead of **local storage**, which meant:
- ❌ Data was lost when the browser tab closed
- ❌ Data was lost when the Node.js process was killed/restarted
- ❌ Data only persisted during the browser session

## Solution Implemented
Migrated from **session storage** to **local storage** for true data persistence:
- ✅ Data persists after browser restart
- ✅ Data persists after Node.js process restart
- ✅ Data persists until explicitly deleted by user
- ✅ Data survives computer restarts

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Created New Local Storage Utility
**File: `src/utils/localStorage.js`**
- Complete replacement for sessionStorage.js
- Uses `localStorage` API instead of `sessionStorage` API
- Maintains same interface for backward compatibility
- Includes both TaskStorage and NoteStorage operations

### 2. Updated All Import References
**Files Updated:**
- `src/store/slices/tasksSlice.js` - Now imports from localStorage.js
- `src/store/slices/notesSlice.js` - Now imports from localStorage.js
- `src/store/store.js` - Updated import path
- `src/store/middleware/sessionStorageMiddleware.js` - Updated import and added backward compatibility
- `src/providers/SessionStorageProvider.js` - Updated import (kept name for compatibility)
- `src/hooks/useSessionStorage.js` - Updated import
- `src/hooks/useAppSessionStorage.js` - Updated import
- `src/components/TaskCreatePanel/TaskCreatePanel.js` - Updated import
- `src/components/NoteEditor/NoteEditor.js` - Updated import
- `src/utils/sampleData.js` - Updated require statements

### 3. Disabled Automatic Sample Data
- Removed automatic sample data initialization on app startup
- Added manual `loadSampleData` actions for development/testing
- Users now start with truly empty storage if no data exists

## Storage Keys Used
```javascript
const LOCAL_STORAGE_KEYS = {
  TASKS: 'quick-look-tasks',
  TASKS_UI_STATE: 'quick-look-tasks-ui-state', 
  NOTES: 'quick-look-notes',
  NOTES_UI_STATE: 'quick-look-notes-ui-state',
  USER_PREFERENCES: 'quick-look-user-preferences',
  APP_STATE: 'quick-look-app-state',
};
```

## Testing the Fix

### To Test Persistence:
1. Create some tasks and notes in the application
2. Stop the Node.js development server (Ctrl+C)
3. Restart the development server (`npm start`)
4. Open the application - your data should still be there!

### To Clear Data (If Needed):
Open browser developer tools and run:
```javascript
localStorage.clear();
```

## Backward Compatibility
- All existing variable names and function names maintained
- Component interfaces unchanged
- Redux action names unchanged
- Only the underlying storage mechanism changed

The application now provides true data persistence that survives browser and server restarts!
